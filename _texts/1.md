- {:.indent-3} From fairest creatures we desire increase,
- {:.indent-3} That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
- {:.indent-3} But as the riper should by time decease,
- {:.indent-3} His tender heir might bear his memory:
- {:.indent-3} But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
- {:.indent-3} Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
- {:.indent-3} Making a famine where abundance lies,
- {:.indent-3} Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
- {:.indent-3} Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
- {:.indent-3} And only herald to the gaudy spring,
- {:.indent-3} Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
- {:.indent-3} And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
- {:.indent-6} Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
- {:.indent-6} To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
