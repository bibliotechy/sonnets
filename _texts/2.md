- {:.indent-3} 
- {:.indent-3} When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
- {:.indent-3} And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
- {:.indent-3} Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
- {:.indent-3} Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
- {:.indent-3} Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
- {:.indent-3} Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
- {:.indent-3} To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
- {:.indent-3} Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
- {:.indent-3} How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
- {:.indent-3} If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
- {:.indent-3} Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
- {:.indent-3} Proving his beauty by succession thine.
- {:.indent-6} This were to be new made when thou art old,
- {:.indent-6} And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
